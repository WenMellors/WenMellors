### Hi, I'm Wenjun Jiang ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am a graduate student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China (UTC+8).
- ðŸŒ± My current research interests primarily focus on spatio-temporal data mining and reinforcement learning, with a goal of simulating real-world human mobility.
- :heart: Our paper titled Continuous Trajectory Generation Based on Two-Stage GAN has been accepted for the 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence [AAAI 2023](https://aaai-23.aaai.org/) conference (CCF A), (Acceptance rate is 19.6%). [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07103), [Code](https://github.com/WenMellors/TS-TrajGen).
- :muscle: I am one of the founding members of the [LibCity](https://github.com/LibCity) open-source project, a comprehensive library of deep learning algorithms for spatio-temporal prediction in urban environments. Our goal is to facilitate the development and credible evaluation of deep learning algorithms of spatio-temporal prediction in urban cities, including traffic speed, trajectory location, and on-demand service. Our team published a demo paper on the project at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2021.  Welcome to our [Repository](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity), [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474717.3483923), and [HomePage](https://libcity.ai/) for more details.
- ðŸ¤” In addition to my research in spatio-temporal data mining and reinforcement learning, I am passionate about exploring other areas of technology. Currently, I am learning how to use Python for stock data analysis and quantitative trading. I believe that combining my data analysis skills with my interest in finance will enable me to make informed decisions in the stock market.
